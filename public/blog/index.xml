      <description>Hello This is my first post from my brand-new blog. I am currently a high-school student at the time I am writing this post, who is extremely passionate about technology and its applications to help eradicate any kind of inequality that exists in this world. It may never be possible to actually achieve that goal, but I will always try.
I have previous experience working on projects with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, mainly on the front-end UI/UX, also with TypeScript and Angular for complex websites.</description>
