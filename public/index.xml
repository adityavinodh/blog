      <description>What is Hugo? Hugo is a static-site generator that helps you generate and build static files like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ahead of time. It is an opensource project built with Go and boasts impressive build times that seems incomparable.
What does it do? It helps you convert markdown files (the files you will be writing your articles or blog posts in) to the static files that will be served later.</description>

      <description>Hello This is my first post from my brand-new blog. I am currently a high-school student at the time I am writing this post, who is extremely passionate about technology and its applications to help eradicate any kind of inequality that exists in this world. It may never be possible to actually achieve that goal, but I will always try.
I have previous experience working on projects with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, mainly on the front-end UI/UX, also with TypeScript and Angular for complex websites.</description>
